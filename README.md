# CNN-Effect-of-Filters-and-Depth
This repository accompanies the tutorial and assignment titled “Convolutional Neural Networks: Effect of Filters and Depth.” It contains the full Jupyter notebook used to train shallow and deep CNN models on the MNIST dataset and to reproduce the graphs, visualisations, and results presented in the report.

The goal of this work is to provide a practical and accessible explanation of how filter size and network depth influence CNN performance. The notebook guides users through model building, training, evaluation, plotting accuracy and loss curves, and visualising feature maps.
